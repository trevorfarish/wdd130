      <!-- TODO: Week 02 - replace [Your audience here] with your audience. Who are they? What are their ages? What do they like to do? Why would they want to look at this website? You could even go as far as giving them names and bios-->
      <p>[Our audience will most likely be in the 20s-30s range, although everyone, no matter their age, is welcome here. Our audience comes to our website because they want informaton pertaining to White Water Rafting, and we seek to help them with that. I imagine our audience will seek out this information either on their phone, or on their desktop.]</p>
