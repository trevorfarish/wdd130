            <h1>Welcome to my Home Page!</h1>
        Welcome to my volleyball website. The intention of this website will be
        to teach you some of the basics of volleyball and give you the best an
        online description can give about the fundamentals of volleyball. As
        someone who has played volleyball consistently for the better part of
        their college career, I believe I am more than capable of giving the
        best tutorial on the basics/fundamentals of volleyball. The basics that
        I will lay out will be as follows; It will outline the rules of
        volleyball, which are that there can only be 6 players on the court per
        team, for a total of 12 on the court as a whole. Second, the team that
        wins the point, which can be done a multitude of ways including the ball
        hitting the ground of the opposing team’s side of the court, or if the
        opposing team hits it out, will serve next. Third, even if the ball
        touches the net, or if you touch it on a block, you may hit it back up.
        Next, if the ball hits the boundary line of the court, it is considered
        in, and the team that the ball will get the point. Also, no matter what
        part of the body hits the player, it will count no matter what, so long
        as there is only one touch to count. If the player touches the ball two,
        three, or more times, it will be the opposing team’s point. Next, when
        hitting the ball, you must not contact it for more than half a second,
        which basically means don’t hold or carry the ball. If you do, it will
        be the opposing teams point. </div>
        <div class="homeparagraphtwo">Next, when serving the ball, you must serve
            the ball from the very back of the designated court boundary. If you
            serve it in front of the line, that is illegal and will be the other
            team’s point. Next, before the serve your team must be in position
            (rotation after each point given going in a clockwise manner), but after
            the serve, your team is allowed to rotate wherever they’d like. However,
            if your position is considered as a backline then you cannot jump above
            the net to attack, or rather at all. If you do, the point will be given
            to the opposing team. Lastly, if you intend to play volleyball in a
            competitive manner, the games are done in typically a best of three or a
            best of five format, with twenty five points to win. However, if the
            score Is twenty-five to twenty-four, the teams must win by two. Meaning,
            just because the team hit twenty-five points, they must get to
            twenty-six (in this case) if they want to win.</div>

                The fundamentals page
            will include a description of the proper form for volleyball. The
            fundamentals include hand placement when receiving, hand placement when
            setting, and how to serve. Hand placement, in short, is one hand
            diagonally placed over the other, with the thumbs closed. Pictures will
            be included to show the proper hand placements. However, the home page
            will be an introduction to the site. It will outline what the site is
            for and also be aesthetically pleasing/easy to navigate.
