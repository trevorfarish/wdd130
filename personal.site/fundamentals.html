        When receiving the volleyball, you want to use the "pancake, pancake,
        sausage, sausage" technique. It sounds really weird, but hear me out. To
        start, you lay your hands on top of each other, specifically on top of
        the fingers, making an X. Then, bring the thumbs and sides of the palms
        inwards to create what is called your "platform." When receiving the ball, 
        you want the ball to hit just above your platform, almost on your wrists.
        if your hands are well positioned, the ball should go straight up. The picture 
        on the left roughly shows how to recieve a volleyball.

      <div class="settingtext">
        When setting the ball, you want your hands above your head, with your arms and elbows 
        bent roughly at a 45 degree angle. Cup your hands slightly, and create some space between your hands, roughly
        about 2-3 inches between your index fingers to create a good hand position to set with. Then, when attempting to
        set the ball, make sure your arms are not stiff, but have some stiffness in your fingers. Not too much, as too much stiffness
        can make you stub your finger. Once the ball is coming towards you, you want to create what is essentially a trampoline with your hands.
        As the ball comes down, you want to let the ball come down just a bit with your hands following it, so as not to smack the ball, and then 
        using your fingers as the precision and thumbs as the power, set the ball. It will take a lot of practice, as setting takes a lot of precision,
        but you can do it.
