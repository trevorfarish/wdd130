      Hey, my name is Trevor Farish. I am a business management major, but I am
      taking this class as a substitute for another one of my classes. Some
      stuff I like to do is video games, volleyball, and lifting weights. I am
      single, not married and no children. I may not need this class for like a
      computer science major, but learning the basics of web design is still
      super cool. I usually wake up at 7 AM because I like to wake up early for
      the gym.<!--this is how you can write comments to those who will see the code.-->
